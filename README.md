The beginnings of a bundle of applications used to power a WiFi-equipped hygrometer (temperature & humidity sensor) for a cigar humidor.

Nothing here yet, but watch this space.

Eventual goals:
* Microcomputer-controlled temperature sensor
* LCD screen for quick easy viewing
* Connected to a local wifi network
* Post updates to a web application
* Website where current and historical data can be viewed
* Updates posted to a Twitter accound
* Pebble app so current data can be read from a smartwatch

Tools being used:
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* DHT22 environment sensor
* Lots of coffee and/or alcohol
