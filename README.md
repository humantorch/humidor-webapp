# Sparklegravy Humidor

The beginnings of a bundle of applications used to power a WiFi-equipped hygrometer (temperature & humidity sensor) for a cigar humidor.

All data is being faked so far (still waiting for the DHT22 to show up in the mail) but you can see how it works at <a href="http://humidor.sparklegravy.com">humidor.sparklegravy.com</a>.

Eventual goals:
* Microcomputer-controlled temperature sensor
* LCD screen for quick easy viewing
* Connected to a local wifi network
* Post updates to a web application
* Website where current and historical data can be viewed
* Updates posted to a Twitter accound
* Pebble app so current data can be read from a smartwatch

Tools being used:
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* DHT22 environment sensor
* Lots of coffee and/or alcohol
* All of this:
